# neon-shell — cyberpunk Hyprland, all the themes

**neon-shell** is [gits](https://github.com/electrocrem/gits) with every theme: *Ghost in the Shell* (the base, below) and
*Serial Experiments Lain* (lavender, cream and wire red), more to come. Switch with `Super+I` → *Colour theme* or `gits-theme set lain`;
`gits-theme set gits` brings GitS back exactly. Fixes to the desktop itself go to gits first and are merged here from it
(`git remote add upstream https://github.com/electrocrem/gits.git && git pull upstream main`).

# gits — Ghost in the Shell for Hyprland

A whole *Ghost in the Shell* desktop for Hyprland: deep navy and cyan phosphor, square corners, thin frames, kanji tags — and a little Lain dancing
where you least expect her. One installer gives your session a new look and feel, one uninstaller takes it away again, and nothing of yours is
overwritten without a backup.

## What you get

**A desktop that feels alive.** Clock, calendar, weather, network, battery, load and a to-do list glow on your wallpaper, next to an audio
spectrum that moves with whatever is playing. The bar at the top shows what you need and nothing more. Windows snap in crisply, and you can
change the motion (or turn it off) any time with `Super+Shift+Y`.

**Everything is one keystroke away.** `Super+A` opens a launcher that finds apps, settings, projects, open windows and notes, and does maths.
`Super+V` is your clipboard history, `Super+Tab` jumps between windows, `Super+,` picks an emoji, and `Super+/` lists every shortcut there is.

**Music, and a radio with a dancer.** `Super+Shift+M` pages through everything that is playing — Spotify, a browser tab, a video — and the last
page is a web radio (DATAMOSH; any AzuraCast station works). It shows what is on air, the cover, how many are listening, and a hologram Lain
who dances on the live spectrum, faster with the music, jumping when the beat hits. `Super+R` opens it straight away.

**A lock screen with a pulse.** The clock glitches now and then, the cursor blinks, a scanner runs along the line, and Lain dances at the
edge of the picture.

**Comfortable basics.** A control panel (`Super+Shift+C`) with the usual toggles and sliders, a sound mixer with one slider per app, a
notification centre, Wi-Fi and Bluetooth menus, on-screen display for volume and brightness, a power menu, quick notes, a focus timer,
screenshots with OCR, screen recording, a night-light schedule, and separate sleep timers for the wall socket and the battery.

**A terminal and apps that match.** A banner in kitty, a themed prompt, tmux, btop, lazygit, yazi, Neovim, VS Code, Dolphin, and styles for
Zen, Logseq, Telegram, Spotify (Spicetify) and Discord (Vesktop). Plus matching icons (Flatpak apps too) and cursors, and login, boot and lock screens in the same style.

**It looks after itself.** `gits-doctor` checks that everything is in order and can repair what an update breaks. `gits-update` takes a
snapshot, updates the system, and then runs the repair.

## Install

You need an Arch-based system with **Hyprland 0.55 or newer** (developed on CachyOS with Hyprland 0.56). The list of packages is in
[`packages.txt`](packages.txt), and `./install.sh --deps` installs them for you.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/electrocrem/gits.git
cd gits
./install.sh --dry-run          # look at what would happen first
./install.sh                    # install for your user, no sudo
./install.sh --system           # plus the login, boot and GRUB screens (asks for sudo)
```

Then **log out and back in** and pick the Hyprland session. Afterwards run `gits-doctor`: it looks over the session, the services, the theme and
the boot screens and tells you if something is off.

**Your files are safe.** Anything the installer would replace is first moved to `~/.local/share/gits-install/backup/<time>/`. It adds a few
clearly marked lines to your zsh and Neovim config and changes nothing else in them. Running the installer twice is harmless.

Want a peek without logging out? `GITS_NESTED=1 Hyprland -c ~/.config/hypr/hyprland.lua` opens the desktop in a window.

Other options: `--telegram` builds a Telegram theme into `~/Downloads`, `--login-guards` helps laptops with hybrid AMD/NVIDIA graphics that sometimes
log in to a black screen, and `--dry-run` only shows what would be done.

## Uninstall

```bash
./uninstall.sh
```

It restores your backups, removes what it created and takes its lines out of your zsh and Neovim config. The login, boot and GRUB screens
need sudo, so the commands to undo them are printed at the end.

## Make it yours

* **Colour theme:** `Super+I` → *Colour theme*, or `gits-theme set NAME`. A theme is a small file in `~/.config/gits/themes/` that gives
  the roles of `gits.theme` (background, accent, red...) other colours; the whole desktop is recoloured from it and `gits-theme set gits`
  brings the originals back exactly. Shipped: `gits` (Ghost in the Shell) and `lain` (Serial Experiments Lain: lavender, cream, wire red).
* **Window motion:** `Super+Shift+Y` — `cyber` (simple and sharp, the default), `gits` (hard snap), `lively` (springs and bounces), or `off`.
* **Wallpaper:** `gits-wall --pick`, or drop pictures into `~/Pictures/wallpapers` — GIFs work too.
* **Another radio station:** set `GITS_RADIO_STREAM` and `GITS_RADIO_API` (any AzuraCast station). Prefer a calmer Lain? `GITS_RADIO_LAIN_SPEED=0.5`;
  no flash on the beat: `GITS_RADIO_FLASH=0`; her own colours: `GITS_RADIO_LAIN=color`.
* **A plainer lock screen:** copy `~/.config/hypr/hyprlock/static.conf` over `~/.config/hypr/hyprlock.conf`.
* **Weather card:** `GITS_WEATHER_LOCATION="Berlin"` (it guesses by IP otherwise).
* **Home server card:** `hl.env("GITS_SERVER", "pi")` in `local.lua` (a Host from `~/.ssh/config`, or `user@host`) shows a Raspberry Pi or any
  Linux box on the desktop: CPU, RAM, temperature, disks, Docker containers and undervoltage. It needs key login and `python3` on the server,
  nothing is installed there. `GITS_SERVER_NAME` changes the name on the card.
* **Add your own rows** to the settings menu in `~/.config/gits/settings.tsv`.
* **Monitors and other per-machine settings:** put them in `~/.config/hypr/gits/local.lua` (for example
  `hl.monitor({ output = "DP-3", mode = "2560x1440@180", position = "0x0", scale = 1 })`). It loads last and the installer never touches it.

## If something looks wrong

Run `gits-doctor` first; `gits-doctor --fix` repairs what an update usually breaks. If GRUB shows
`error: ... sparse file not allowed. Press any key` on every boot, run `./install.sh --fix-grub`. More in [docs/PITFALLS.md](docs/PITFALLS.md).
